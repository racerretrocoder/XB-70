    To reach cruise altitude and speed :
    - apply full throttle,
    - "speed with pitch", set the speed to 300 kts and wait until about 38/40 000 ft,
    - set the speed to 450 kts : you're going to have a short dive, pass mach 1, then resume your climb,
    (you may pass the mach without diving, it's just easier that way)
    - wait some minutes, you're going to fly at mach 3.1, at more than 70 000 ft.

    Wing tips folding :
    - necessary to prevent nose-down pitching, as the aerodynamic center of the wing moves backward with speed,
    - again, be patient, complete folding needs 65s,
    - first step at mach 0.95 or 400 kts IAS, whichever is lower,
    - complete folding above mach 1.4.

    Flaps :
    - one position only, beware the high pitching moment (the canards are far ahead the CoG),
    - only below 270 kts IAS.

    Many thanks to Pierre Duval for this fantastic model.
